Once upon a time, there was an 15 year old girl named Sara. She had rainbow hair and a pet dog named snickers. One day she decided to take snickers on a walk. She took a different trail than usual and got lost. Sara also forgot to bring her phone with her. She was in the middle of a forest and it was dark and cold and she had no food. She was all alone with Snickers.
Sara felt very desperate. She did not know whether she can go back home today. She sat under the tree and murmured,"I should obey mom's advice that I should check whether I bring the phone when I am going to leave home."However, she suddenly heard the sound of her alarm. She felt very surprised. She started finding her phone. However, she cannot find her phone all the time, and the alarm has not stopped. She starts feeling afraid.x
