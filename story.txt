Once upon a time, there was a 15 year old girl named Sara. She had rainbow hair and a pet dog named snickers. One day she decided to take snickers on a walk. She took a different trail than usual and got lost. Sara also forgot to bring her phone with her. She was in the middle of a forest and it was dark and cold and she had no food. She was all alone with Snickers.
Sara felt very desperate. She did not know whether she can go back home today. She sat under the tree and murmured,"I should obey mom's advice that I should check whether I bring the phone when I am going to leave home."However, she suddenly heard the sound of her alarm. She felt very surprised. She started finding her phone. However, she cannot find her phone all the time, and the alarm has not stopped. She starts feeling afraid.
Out of no where, Snickers jumped on top of Sarah with her phone in his mouth. It seemed that she had dropped it a ways back, but he saved the day! Sarah opened her phone to turn off the alarm and realized why it was going off-- she had set a reminder.  It said "don't forget to submit your assignment!!!". She looked at her watch:  4:33 pm.  The assignment was due in 27 minutes.  Freaking out once more, Sarah started to run home with Snickers alongside her.
Sara and Snickers ran for a long time but still did not get home. The alarm clock at five o'clock rang and they finally got lost. Sara was sad because this assignment accounted for 30% of the total score. Sara will fail this course! Suddenly, the president of Sara's school appeared. He told Sara that if she did not want to get F, she would have to do extra work, time-travel. Sara needed to go to New York for fifteen years and tell the police a name, Jeff Hardy.
