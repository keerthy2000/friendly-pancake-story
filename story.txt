Once upon a time, there was an 15 year old girl named Sara. She had rainbow hair and a pet dog named snickers. One day she decided to take snickers on a walk. She took a different trail than usual and got lost. Sara also forgot to bring her phone with her. She was in the middle of a forest and it was dark and cold and she had no food. She was all alone with Snickers.
